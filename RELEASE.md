## Version changing

Version changing is described in the table above.

For example, the next commit message will trigger a `major` number changing:

```text
feat!: Change the logic of transaction handling
```

And the next message will change only a `patch` number:

```text
feat: Add new transaction type
```

## How to setup

### `semantic-release` related packages

It's neede to setup the next packages as `devDependencies` in `package.json`:

```text
    "@semantic-release/changelog": "^6.0.1",
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer": "^9.0.2",
    "@semantic-release/git": "^10.0.1",
    "@semantic-release/github": "^8.0.4",
    "@semantic-release/npm": "^9.0.1",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator": "^10.0.3",
    "conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits": "^5.0.0",
    "semantic-release": "^19.0.2",
```

- `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits` is needed for analyzing commits in `conventionalcommits` style as described  [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
It's fully compatible with `commitlint`.

### Semantic config

For now, the main config is placed in the root directory, and file named as `.releaserc`:

```yaml
{
  "branches": [
      "main",
    {
      "name": "develop",
      "channel": "beta",
      "prerelease": true
    }
  ],
  "tagFormat": "${version}",
  "ci": true,
  "preset": "conventionalcommits",
  "plugins": [
      "@semantic-release/npm",
      "@semantic-release/changelog",
      "@semantic-release/github",
    [ "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
      {
        "parserOpts": "./.github/linters/.commitlint.rules.js",
        "releaseRules": [
          { "breaking": true, "release": "major" },
          { "type": "feat", "release": "minor" },
          { "type": "fix", "release": "patch" },
          { "type": "perf", "release": "patch" },
          { "type": "build", "release": "patch" },
          { "scope": "no-release", "release": false },
          { "scope": "security", "release": "patch" }
        ],
        "presetConfig": true
      }
    ],
    [ "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
      {
        "presetConfig": true
      }
    ],
    [ "@semantic-release/git",
      {
        "assets": ["package.json", "CHANGELOG.md"],
        "message": "chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

`branches` parameter is describing what the branches will be used for creating releases in the future. For the format as `release/1.0.x` is suggested.

P.S.
For now, functionality of `range` parameter for `branches` is broken and we cannot use the ability to fail wth error in case of trying to make a breaking change release inside the current family.

### Workflow steps

Due to github actions steps the main thing here is the command `npx semantic-release --debug` that will run the whole process for analyzing, checking and publishing release with artifacts. Also, pacakge will be published to npm registry
The example of this workflow can be:

```yaml
name: "Release"
on:
  pull_request_target:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
    types:
      - closed
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: '**/package-lock.json'

      - name: "Run semantic release"
        run: |
          npm ci
          npx semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

### NPM registry

For now, we are using github as a npm registry. `publishConfig` is placed in `package.json` file:

```json
"publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
  }
```
